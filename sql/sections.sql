47	Bio	\N	1	\N	\N	\N	<p class="fw-light mb-1">\n  Paul was born at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles, CA, and spent his early years in Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley. At 8, his family moved to Newhall, CA (now Santa Clarita), where he lived until his 30s before heading up to Washington state.\n</p>\n<p>Paul became a Christian at 14 after reading The Late Great Planet Earth, and he got involved with several churches, including Agape, a "Jesus People" church. With a couple of friends, he formed a small vocal group, performing at various churches. When he turned 18, he went on to attend Biola College.\n</p>\n<p>\n  He met his wife, Virginia, when he was 16. They didn’t fall in love right away but quickly became best friends, staying close for seven years before getting married. Paul loves music, and he and Virginia even played in a band together called Born Again, with him on guitar and vocals and Virginia singing. Virginia’s daughter, Joy, was nine months old when they got married, and Paul loved being a dad. They sang to each other at their wedding, and not long after, they moved to Washington. A year later, they welcomed their son, Jonathan.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Jonathan had a challenging start in life—he was diagnosed with a heart defect (aortic stenosis) at just over a month old, requiring open-heart surgery. Over the years, he’s been through two heart surgeries, including a valve replacement and pacemaker implant at 14. Despite a few close calls, Jon’s resilience shines through. In 1998, the family moved to Orcas Island, which has been home ever since.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Paul’s daughter, Joy, now has three children: Brandon, Kevin, and Jessica. They all live together on Orcas Island, making it a true extended family home.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Originally planning to study psychology, Paul switched to computer science after his parents gifted him a computer. After graduating, he launched a career as a software engineer, working for various companies. A highlight was joining <a href="/employment?section_name=amazon" target="_blank">Amazon.com</a> in its early startup days, where he played a key role in developing their shipping software, boosting performance by 85%.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Today, Paul, Virginia, Joy, Jon, and Brandon, Kevin, and Jessica are happily settled on Orcas Island, enjoying life together as one big family.\n</p>	2024-11-16 15:44:48.406331	2024-11-29 18:39:53.493798	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

While he has extensive professional experience, much of his work has been on the back-end, leaving little visual material to showcase. However, Paul’s background also includes a significant amount of front-end work that can be highlighted. This portfolio aims to present Paul’s broad expertise in a way that is accessible and engaging for those unfamiliar with his work.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Paul's skill set is extensive, to the point where listing everything he's worked on can feel overwhelming. However, it's important to showcase his abilities for potential employers. His expertise ranges from current technologies to older ones that he hasn’t used in a while.\n  At one point, Paul was proficient in over 30 programming languages, including niche ones like PostScript, Forth, COBOL, and Lisp. This highlights his ability to quickly learn and adapt to new technologies. For example, if he's unfamiliar with a language like Go, he can pick it up rapidly.\n  Today, Paul focuses on widely-used languages such as Ruby on Rails and Python, but he is also proficient in C, C++, and Java.\n  <p>	2024-11-16 08:43:01.457896	2024-11-29 18:39:53.632529	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

It is active during the day, unlike many other octopus species that are nocturnal.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Raccoon Butterflyfish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Raccoon Butterflyfish (Chaetodon lunula). It is easily recognized by its bright yellow body, black eye band, and distinctive black markings on its dorsal side. This species is common in coral reef environments in the Indo-Pacific region.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Scrawled Filefish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a a Scrawled Filefish (Aluterus scriptus). It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body, pale yellowish-brown color with blue spots and irregular lines, and a small, pointed mouth. The Scrawled Filefish is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, often near coral reefs or rocky areas. It is known for its ability to change colors slightly to blend with its surroundings.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Spotted Eagle Ray\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Spotted Eagle Ray (Aetobatus narinari). It is easily recognized by its distinct pattern of white spots on its dark dorsal side, long tail, and broad, wing-like pectoral fins. These rays are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, often swimming gracefully in open water or near coral reefs. They are known for their ability to leap out of the water and their long, whip-like tail, which may have venomous spines.\n    This leads to a funny story. When Paul was 18 he was snorkeling in Florida. He was floating vertical when one of his friends tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up and his friend was point down. He looked down and saw a string ray not more that two feet directly beneath him, scary!\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Sea Slug\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Chromodoris annae, a type of nudibranch (sea slug). It is part of the family Chromodorididae and is known for its vibrant coloration. The bright yellow body with white spots, bordered by a blue and black margin, is characteristic of this species. Nudibranchs like Chromodoris annae are commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region, often in coral reef environments. Their striking colors serve as a warning to predators of their toxicity.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Black Triggerfish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a a Black Triggerfish (Melichthys niger), also commonly known as the Black Durgon. It is characterized by its deep black coloration, sleek body, and white-tipped dorsal and anal fins. The faint turquoise-blue outlines on its fins are another identifying feature. These fish are commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters, often near coral reefs. They are known for their agility and ability to lock themselves into crevices using their trigger-like dorsal spine.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Trumpetfish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Trumpetfish (Aulostomus chinensis), a species of elongated, pipe-like fish commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters. It is characterized by its long body, pointed snout, and small fins. Trumpetfish are masters of camouflage, often aligning themselves with vertical structures like sea whips or swimming alongside other fish to ambush prey. They are commonly observed in coral reef environments and can change their coloration to blend with their surroundings.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Moorish Idols\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    These are Moorish Idols (Zanclus cornutus). They are highly recognizable due to their striking coloration: black, white, and yellow bands, and their long, filamentous dorsal fin extension. Moorish Idols are often mistaken for certain species of angelfish or butterflyfish but are actually in their own unique family (Zanclidae). They are found in tropical and subtropical reefs across the Indo-Pacific and are known for their graceful swimming and striking appearance.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Sea Urchin\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Long-Spined Sea Urchin (Diadema setosum). It is characterized by its black, needle-like spines that can grow quite long, and a small, round body. This species often has a distinguishing orange or red ring near its anal cone, visible from above. Long-spined sea urchins are commonly found in tropical and subtropical coral reefs and play an essential role in the ecosystem by grazing on algae that can otherwise overgrow corals. However, their spines are sharp and venomous, so caution is advised when handling or encountering them.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Clownfish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is a Clark's Anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii), a species of clownfish. It is easily identified by its black body, bright orange fins, and two to three white bands across its body. Unlike other clownfish species, Clark's anemonefish is highly adaptable and can associate with a variety of host anemones. It is commonly found in tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. This species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in diverse environments.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Brown Crab\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    This is likely a Brown Crab (Cancer pagurus) or a similar large crustacean species. Its robust claws and wide, oval-shaped carapace suggest it is an adaptation for protection and predation in rocky or coral reef environments. While exact species identification can vary based on location and detailed characteristics, this crab appears to be well-suited to reef ecosystems and is likely a nocturnal scavenger or predator. If this was observed in the Indo-Pacific region, it might belong to a local reef crab species.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Unicornfish\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    These are Orangespine Unicornfish (Naso lituratus), also commonly called Naso Tangs or Orange-Bar Surgeonfish. They are easily recognized by their dark gray to brown body, the orange marking near their tail, and their elongated body shape. They often travel in schools like the one in the image and are commonly found in coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. This species feeds primarily on algae and is a popular sight for divers due to their vibrant markings and schooling behavior.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Blue-and-Yellow Fusiliers\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    These are Blue-and-Yellow Fusiliers (Caesio teres), a species of fusilier fish commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters. They are characterized by their streamlined blue bodies with a yellow tail and often a yellow stripe running along their sides. These fish are typically seen schooling in large groups in open water near coral reefs. They are fast swimmers and feed primarily on plankton, making them a vital part of the reef ecosystem.\n  </p>\n</section>\n<title>\n  Great Barrier Reef\n</title>\n<section>\n  <p>\n    As mentioned above, Paul and Virginia dove the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.
