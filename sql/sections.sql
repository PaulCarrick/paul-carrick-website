2	Bio	1	\N	\N	\N	<p class="fw-light mb-1">\nPaul was born at Queen of Angels Hospital in Los Angeles, CA, and spent his early years in Panorama City in the San Fernando Valley. At 8, his family moved to Newhall, CA (now Santa Clarita), where he lived until his 30s before heading up to Washington state.\n</p>\nPaul became a Christian at 14 after reading The Late Great Planet Earth, and he got involved with several churches, including Agape, a "Jesus People" church. With a couple of friends, he formed a small vocal group, performing at various churches. When he turned 18, he went on to attend Biola College.\n</p>\n<P>\nHe met his wife, Virginia, when he was 16. They didn’t fall in love right away but quickly became best friends, staying close for seven years before getting married. Paul loves music, and he and Virginia even played in a band together called Born Again, with him on guitar and vocals and Virginia singing. Virginia’s daughter, Joy, was nine months old when they got married, and Paul loved being a dad. They sang to each other at their wedding, and not long after, they moved to Washington. A year later, they welcomed their son, Jonathan.\n</p>\n<P>\nJonathan had a challenging start in life—he was diagnosed with a heart defect (aortic stenosis) at just over a month old, requiring open-heart surgery. Over the years, he’s been through two heart surgeries, including a valve replacement and pacemaker implant at 14. Despite a few close calls, Jon’s resilience shines through. In 1998, the family moved to Orcas Island, which has been home ever since.\n</p>\n<P>\nPaul’s daughter, Joy, now has three children: Brandon, Kevin, and Jessica. They all live together on Orcas Island, making it a true extended family home.\n</p>\n<p>\nOriginally planning to study psychology, Paul switched to computer science after his parents gifted him a computer. After graduating, he launched a career as a software engineer, working for various companies. A highlight was joining <a href="employment.html#amazon" target="_blank">Amazon</a> in its early startup days, where he played a key role in developing their shipping software, boosting performance by 85%.\n</p>\n<p>\nToday, Paul, Virginia, Joy, Jon, and Brandon, Kevin, and Jessica are happily settled on Orcas Island, enjoying life together as one big family.\n</p>\n	2024-11-16 15:44:48.406331	2024-11-16 15:44:48.406331

It is characterized by its dark brown to black body covered with white spots and a distinctive white inside of its mouth, which is where its name comes from. This species is commonly found in coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific region..\n</p></section>\n<title>\nWhitetip Reef Shark\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Whitetip Reef Shark (Triaenodon obesus). It is easily identified by the white tips on its dorsal and caudal fins, along with its slender body and rounded snout. Whitetip reef sharks are nocturnal hunters commonly found resting on the seafloor during the day in coral reefs throughout the Indo-Pacific. They are non-aggressive and are a common sight for divers in these regions.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nDay Octopus\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Day Octopus (Octopus cyanea), also known as the Big Blue Octopus. It is commonly found in coral reefs and shallow waters of the Indo-Pacific region. The Day Octopus is known for its ability to change color and texture rapidly to blend into its surroundings, making it a master of camouflage. It is active during the day, unlike many other octopus species that are nocturnal.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nRaccoon Butterflyfish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Raccoon Butterflyfish (Chaetodon lunula). It is easily recognized by its bright yellow body, black eye band, and distinctive black markings on its dorsal side. This species is common in coral reef environments in the Indo-Pacific region.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nScrawled Filefish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a a Scrawled Filefish (Aluterus scriptus). It is characterized by its elongated, flattened body, pale yellowish-brown color with blue spots and irregular lines, and a small, pointed mouth. The Scrawled Filefish is typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, often near coral reefs or rocky areas. It is known for its ability to change colors slightly to blend with its surroundings.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nSpotted Eagle Ray\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Spotted Eagle Ray (Aetobatus narinari). It is easily recognized by its distinct pattern of white spots on its dark dorsal side, long tail, and broad, wing-like pectoral fins. These rays are typically found in tropical and subtropical waters, often swimming gracefully in open water or near coral reefs. They are known for their ability to leap out of the water and their long, whip-like tail, which may have venomous spines.\nThis leads to a funny story. When Paul was 18 he was snorkeling in Florida. He was floating vertical when one of his friends tapped him on the shoulder. He looked up and his friend was point down. He looked down and saw a string ray not more that two feet directly beneath him, scary!\n</p></section>\n<title>\nSea Slug\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Chromodoris annae, a type of nudibranch (sea slug). It is part of the family Chromodorididae and is known for its vibrant coloration. The bright yellow body with white spots, bordered by a blue and black margin, is characteristic of this species. Nudibranchs like Chromodoris annae are commonly found in the Indo-Pacific region, often in coral reef environments. Their striking colors serve as a warning to predators of their toxicity.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nBlack Triggerfish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a a Black Triggerfish (Melichthys niger), also commonly known as the Black Durgon. It is characterized by its deep black coloration, sleek body, and white-tipped dorsal and anal fins. The faint turquoise-blue outlines on its fins are another identifying feature. These fish are commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters, often near coral reefs. They are known for their agility and ability to lock themselves into crevices using their trigger-like dorsal spine.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nTrumpetfish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Trumpetfish (Aulostomus chinensis), a species of elongated, pipe-like fish commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters. It is characterized by its long body, pointed snout, and small fins. Trumpetfish are masters of camouflage, often aligning themselves with vertical structures like sea whips or swimming alongside other fish to ambush prey. They are commonly observed in coral reef environments and can change their coloration to blend with their surroundings.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nMoorish Idols\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThese are Moorish Idols (Zanclus cornutus). They are highly recognizable due to their striking coloration: black, white, and yellow bands, and their long, filamentous dorsal fin extension. Moorish Idols are often mistaken for certain species of angelfish or butterflyfish but are actually in their own unique family (Zanclidae). They are found in tropical and subtropical reefs across the Indo-Pacific and are known for their graceful swimming and striking appearance.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nSea Urchin\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Long-Spined Sea Urchin (Diadema setosum). It is characterized by its black, needle-like spines that can grow quite long, and a small, round body. This species often has a distinguishing orange or red ring near its anal cone, visible from above. Long-spined sea urchins are commonly found in tropical and subtropical coral reefs and play an essential role in the ecosystem by grazing on algae that can otherwise overgrow corals. However, their spines are sharp and venomous, so caution is advised when handling or encountering them.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nClownfish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is a Clark's Anemonefish (Amphiprion clarkii), a species of clownfish. It is easily identified by its black body, bright orange fins, and two to three white bands across its body. Unlike other clownfish species, Clark's anemonefish is highly adaptable and can associate with a variety of host anemones. It is commonly found in tropical waters of the Indo-Pacific region. This species is known for its hardy nature and ability to thrive in diverse environments.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nBrown Crab\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThis is likely a Brown Crab (Cancer pagurus) or a similar large crustacean species. Its robust claws and wide, oval-shaped carapace suggest it is an adaptation for protection and predation in rocky or coral reef environments. While exact species identification can vary based on location and detailed characteristics, this crab appears to be well-suited to reef ecosystems and is likely a nocturnal scavenger or predator. If this was observed in the Indo-Pacific region, it might belong to a local reef crab species.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nUnicornfish\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThese are Orangespine Unicornfish (Naso lituratus), also commonly called Naso Tangs or Orange-Bar Surgeonfish. They are easily recognized by their dark gray to brown body, the orange marking near their tail, and their elongated body shape. They often travel in schools like the one in the image and are commonly found in coral reefs in the Indo-Pacific. This species feeds primarily on algae and is a popular sight for divers due to their vibrant markings and schooling behavior.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nBlue-and-Yellow Fusiliers\n</title>\n<section><p>\nThese are Blue-and-Yellow Fusiliers (Caesio teres), a species of fusilier fish commonly found in tropical and subtropical waters. They are characterized by their streamlined blue bodies with a yellow tail and often a yellow stripe running along their sides. These fish are typically seen schooling in large groups in open water near coral reefs. They are fast swimmers and feed primarily on plankton, making them a vital part of the reef ecosystem.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nGreat Barrier Reef\n</title>\n<section><p>\nAs mentioned above, Paul and Virginia dove the Great Barrier Reef in Australia. This is the outer wall. It was scary diving there as the wall drops off to nothing.\n</p></section>\n<title>\nSunken Ship (USS Kittiwake)\n</title>\n<section><p>\nIn the Grand Caymans Paul and Virginia dove the USS Kittiwake.\nThe USS Kittiwake is a former U.S. Navy submarine rescue vessel intentionally sunk in 2011 to create an artificial reef. Located off Seven Mile Beach, the wreck rests at depths ranging from 15 to 64 feet, making it suitable for both snorkelers and divers. The site is teeming with marine life, including tropical fish, sea turtles, and rays.\n</p></section>\n	2024-11-16 08:43:01.457896	2024-11-21 14:37:31.608256

By the time Paul left, the DC Software team had grown to nearly 100 engineers, Amazon was shipping a wide range of products, operated 11 DCs (including four internationally), and processed each shipment, including label printing, in under four seconds.\n</p>\n<p class="fw-light mb-1">\nPaul designed and implemented the entire software system Amazon used to ship packages after they were packed. This system handled carrier cost and speed calculations, carrier selection based on various criteria, and generated shipping labels, manifests, customs documents, and shipment records. The process was automated and ran in real time, requiring each step, including label printing, to be completed in under four seconds. The system was also flexible enough to adapt to various carrier requirements, including international carriers, and could adjust to seasonal demands or special promotions with minimal lead time.\n\nThe work for Amazon was done in C, C++, and Perl on HP-UX, connected to an Oracle SQL database. Paul worked on-site.\n</p>\n	2024-11-16 08:43:01.457896	2024-11-16 08:43:01.457896
